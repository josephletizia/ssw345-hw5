**Design**

*1.) What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?*

Helping establish how to tackle the project going forward. With design methods being in the back of my mind the entire time it allowed for more efficency when building the Bot. How to approach its interactions with the suers wsa affected most by this.

*2.) What was most difficult? What would you do differently?*

Understanding space better with the designing of the bot.Having the bot understand what user is saying what and recoginizing what function it needs to proceed with was definitely the most difficult part of designing the bot. In the future, having a better understanding of tackling space will be he best way of moving forward.

*3.) What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?*

Space Reactors are definitely something I would want to mess around with more in the future. They are a really cool interaction for the bot to have where it is able to identify where they are receiving the message from. 

**Implementation**

*1.) What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?*

The practice of continuous integration was by far the most helpful part of our bot project. It allowed for many advantages such as detecting our bug fixes quicker, overally saving on time and effort, and allowed for us to improve upon our implementation the more we were into the project.

*2.) What was most difficult? What would you do differently?*

Originally the alarm function was the most difficult portion of our Focus Bot. Coming up with the how to implement it to work alongside with every other component of the Bot had its difficulties. We probably would have brught down the complexity of the alarm functionality for the Bot next time around. instead of it being customizable it probably would have been a better idea ot make it a static sound for the first prototype of the bot.

*3.) What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?*

Pair programming and overall sit togethers. It helped significantly to develop code alongside with the group and led to a quicker development time with less time eing spent on bugfixing.

**Process**

*1.) What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?*

The implementation of kanban and code review was the ability to vastly improve our code as well as staying organized throughout the entire process.

*2.) What was most difficult? What would you do differently?*

Repeation in code. I have a bad habit of repeating practices in code and if they turn out to be bad implementations of a solution, it can really eat away time during coding. This can also result in duplication of code, which is something I need to try and get away from in the future.

*3.) What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?*

Kanban is a very useful tool that I use for most of my software engineering projects. I will be looking at continuing to use kanban in future projects because of its sheer effectiveness.

**Overall**

*Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.*

I really want to focus on the usefulness of kanban and pair programming together. Having a team that works alongside each other while understanding the usefulness of organization of tasks is very important for teh effectiveness of a development cycle to flourish. In the future and currently for my other projects, the implementation of these two methodologies go hand and hand with each other while establishing better code overall. Kaban allows for the tackling of a prooject one small step at a time and then the implementation of developing the task is a better overall experience when you have more than one set of eyes on the code. Both of these practices are extremely benefiticial for a project overall.
